# Binary Tree Partition Method for Joint Probabilistic Data Association (JPDA)

## Introduction

Rezatofighi et al. introduced a method to generate the *M* best solutions to the binary linear program used for associating detections to tracks. Their work is proposed in *Joint Probabilistic Data Association Revisited* (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7410706).
